# WiFiDog Configuration file

# Parameter: GatewayID
# Default: default
# Optional
#
# Set this to the node ID on the auth server
# This is used to give a customized login page to the clients and for
# monitoring/statistics purpose. If you run multiple gateways on the same
# machine each gateway needs to have a different gateway id.
# If none is supplied, the mac address of the GatewayInterface interface will be used,
# without the : separators

# GatewayID default

# Parameter: ExternalInterface
# Default: NONE
# Optional
#
# Set this to the external interface (the one going out to the Inernet or your larger LAN).  
# Typically vlan1 for OpenWrt, and eth0 or ppp0 otherwise,
# Normally autodetected

ExternalInterface eth1

# Parameter: GatewayInterface
# Default: NONE
# Mandatory
#
# Set this to the internal interface (typically your wifi interface).    
# Typically br0 for whiterussian, br-lan for kamikaze (by default the wifi interface is bridged with wired lan in openwrt)
# and eth1, wlan0, ath0, etc. otherwise
# You can get this interface with the ifconfig command and finding your wifi interface

GatewayInterface br-lan

# Parameter: FirewallRuleSet
# Default: none

# Groups a number of FirewallRule statements together.

# Parameter: FirewallRule
# Default: none

# Rule Set: global
# 
# Used for rules to be applied to all other rulesets except locked.

    ## Use the following if you don't want clients to be able to access machines on 
    ## the private LAN that gives internet access to wifidog.  Note that this is not
    ## client isolation;  The laptops will still be able to talk to one another, as
    ## well as to any machine bridged to the wifi of the router.
    # FirewallRule block to 192.168.0.0/16
    # FirewallRule block to 172.16.0.0/12
    # FirewallRule block to 10.0.0.0/8
    
    ## This is an example ruleset for the Teliphone service.
    #FirewallRule allow udp to 69.90.89.192/27

    ## Use the following to log or ulog the traffic you want to allow or block.
    # For OPENWRT: use of these feature requires modules ipt_LOG or ipt_ULOG present in dependencies
    # iptables-mod-extra and iptables-mod-ulog (to adapt it to the linux distribution).
    # Note: the log or ulog rule must be passed before, the rule you want to match.
    # for openwrt: use of these feature requires modules ipt_LOG or ipt_ULOG present in dependencies
    # iptables-mod-extra and iptables-mod-ulog
    # For example, you want to log (ulog works the same way) the traffic allowed on port 80 to the ip 69.90.89.205:
    #FirewallRule log tcp port 80 to 69.90.89.205
    #FirewallRule allow tcp port 80 to 69.90.89.205
    # And you want to know, who matche your block rule:
    #FirewallRule log to 0.0.0.0/0
    #FirewallRule block to 0.0.0.0/0
